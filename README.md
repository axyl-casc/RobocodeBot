# 🌟 Infinite Mind Pictures Robocode Bot

Welcome to the **Simple and Fun Robocode Bot Demo**! 🤖✨

Get ready to code, build, and battle your own virtual tank robot with this fun and beginner-friendly project! Perfect for young coders who love action, strategy, and a bit of friendly competition.

## 🛠️ Building Your Bot

Use the handy `compile.bat` script (requires Java 11 or newer) to build your bot on **Windows**:

```bat
compile.bat
```

🧠 This script compiles `TankBot.java` and `TargetLocator.java` using the libraries found in the `lib` folder located one level above this project.

---

## 🚀 Running Your Bot

Start the bot with the compiled classes and included library:

```cmd
copy Bot\.env.example Bot\.env
rem ✏️ Edit Bot\.env and adjust SERVER_SECRET if needed
TankBot.cmd
```

Alternatively, run `build.bat` to create a runnable `TankBot.jar`. When you run the jar, a small dialog will pop up where you can enter the server URL and secret. 🔐🌐
