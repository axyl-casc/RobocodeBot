# RobocodeBot
Simple and fun Robocode Bot Demo

## Building

Use `compile.bat` (requires Java 11 or newer) to compile the Java sources on Windows:

```bat
compile.bat
```

This script compiles `TankBot.java` and `TargetLocator.java` using the
libraries found in the `lib` folder one level above this project.

## Running

After compiling, run the bot using `TankBot.cmd`:

```cmd
TankBot.cmd
```

This command starts the bot with the compiled classes and included library.
